Research on the contact pattern of infectious diseases: Nowadays, facing complex population contact relationships, the key challenge is how to construct a contact complex network that can characterize the contact characteristics of the population and track the dynamic changes of infectious disease transmission. In this research, the traditional subjective investigation as the main data collection method can easily lead to biased results. In addition, the traditional infectious disease model relies on a single assumption of contact network for population contact patterns. Therefore, our solution is to construct a population migration network between cities based on large-scale population movement and contact pattern data, and infer the probability of virus transmission. Combined with census data, we couple the contact patterns of individuals of different age groups and construct an individual contact complex network for households. Its scientific value can provide data support for infectious disease research and decision-making reference for epidemic prevention and control.
