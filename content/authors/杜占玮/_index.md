Dr. Zhanwei Du works as an Assistant Professor (Research) in the School of Public Health, The University of Hong Kong (HKU). He received his PhD in Computer Science from Jilin University in 2015. Before joining HKU, he was a postdoc fellow at the Hong Kong Baptist University during 2015-2016 and the University of Texas at Austin during 2016-2020, and a research associate at the University of Texas at Austin in 2020. His general research area is computational epidemiology, machine learning, and data science. He mainly focuses on modeling complex phenomena in biological and social systems. The applications include computational social science with an emphasis on smart city and computational biology covering a wide range of communicable and non-communicable diseases (e.g., COVID-19, influenza, Ebola, sexual transmission infections, and cancer).

He has published high-profile papers in peer-reviewed journals including Science, Nature Medicine, Lancet Public Health, Nature Communications, PNAS, Clinical Infectious Disease, Journal of Travel Medicine, and Emerging Infectious Disease. Among them, the paper (EID 26, 2267-2269, 2020) is considered by the paper (Nature 589, 491-492, 2021) to be one of the important researches in COVID-19 epidemiology in 2020, affirming the outstanding achievements of the Chinese government in containing the epidemic. Dr. Du's research has a significant impact on pandemic response policies. For instance, my ‘Emerging Infectious Diseases 26, 1049–1052 (2020)’ was the first COVID-19 article published in the CDC's official journal; ‘Emerging Infectious Diseases 26, 1341–1343 (2020)’was the first article to provide statistically significant evidence of COVID-19 transmission before symptoms appeared.; ‘Science 369, 1106-1109 (2020)’ demonstrated for the first time that serial interval distribution can alter over time during a growing pandemic (e.g., COVID-19). These findings have been noted by the WTO, CDC, Nature Editorials, Nature News, etc. At the same time, the paper (EID 26, 2361-2369, 2020) with co-first-author, as the most important scientific basis for the issuance of the urban home order in Austin, Texas, was presented at its government press conference in 2020. Up to now, more than 100 high-quality papers have been published; 2 Chinese invention patents for early warning mechanisms for major new infectious diseases have been published. He has served as an academic guest/invited editor for four journals and several funding agencies.
